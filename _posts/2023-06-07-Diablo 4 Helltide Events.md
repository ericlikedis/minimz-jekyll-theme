When you guys hit World Tier 3, do helltide events everytime you can, they're stupidly important because they're the only source of Forgotten Souls and you need a lot of them to keep upgrading/rerolling gear. I skimped out on them and wish I didn't now.

- There is a timer for the Helltide Event here: [https://d4events.live/](https://d4events.live/) - The event is up for one hour and then down for 1 hour 15 minutes until the next one.

- The general gist of Helltides is roam around, kill packs for cinders, do world events (more mobs more cinders) and open Helltide Chests
 
- When Hellfire meteors rain down, it means a Helltide Elite is spawning nearby and they drop a fair amount as well

- Forgotten Souls can also come from normal helltide chests, and Screaming Hell Veins

- This site shows the POSSIBLE spawn locations of the mystery chests - [https://d4armory.io/map/](https://d4armory.io/map/) These require 175 cinders to open and can give a bunch of legs and crafting mats (ex - [https://i.imgur.com/oGb2dvc.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/oGb2dvc.jpeg)) The chests DO NOT SHOW on the map (until you are very close, and when you go away, the icon will disappear) so if you find it, pin NEAR it (not on the chest icon otherwise it will disappear) and come back if you can't open it. PRIO THESE CHESTS OVER ALL

- Mystery Chests will move at the top of the hour (When the IRL clock hits xx:00) meaning you can get multiple chests. Multiple can spawn at once with one per large region zone.

- The official D4 server has a channel for people to post where the chests are located during events - [https://discord.com/invite/diablo4#discord](https://discord.com/invite/diablo4#discord)


Edit 1: - [/u/Prowner1](https://www.reddit.com/u/Prowner1/) has made a site and added a Helltide Tracker to it which allows inputs from users to show where the chests are on the current event - [https://diablo4.life/trackers/helltide](https://diablo4.life/trackers/helltide)

Edit 2: Changed the Mystery Chest movement time, it appears to be top of the hour. (The chests moving is honestly the most confusing part)

I fucking hate this event and hope they allow you to get Forgotten Souls somewhere else in the game.
